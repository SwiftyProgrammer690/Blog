Hi guys! I will teach you how to make a blog with a simple deno script (only 14 lines of code!!!) and deploy it with deno deploy (completely free btw). What will the finished result look like??? It will look like this blog website itself!

What do you need?
- Replit Account
- Github Account
- Deno Deploy Account

Great! Now that you (probably) have your things that you need, you can watch the tutorials below!
