Hello, I have updated the fireworks dependency(an opensource project I have been working on here: https://github.com/SwiftyProgrammer690/fireworks) to have a lot of security! This includes:

• Dependabot alerts
• Code CI/CD
• Code QL

And that will improve this projects security! You can see the full change log below!

What's Changed?

• docs: add SwiftyProgrammer690 as a contributor for review by @allcontributors in #34
• add code-ql analysis for security

Full Changelog: v1.4...v1.5
