Happy Diwali! Whether you don't celebrate this holiday, you can still celebrate it with many things to do if you are a developer!

First things up is... (*drumroll please*), The [Replit Diwali Jam](https://blog.replit.com/India%20Part%201#:~:text=PSA%20about%20our%20upcoming%20Diwali%20Diya%20Jam%3A) where you create a [Diya Animation](https://replit.com/@SwaritChoudhari/Diwali-Diya-Vanilla-CSS#index.html) for a chance to win a free *Hacker* plan from replit!

Another thing you can do is, contribute to indian open source projects on [Github](https://github.com) and let the maintainers take a break and celebrate diwali!

That's all for today! See ya next time!
